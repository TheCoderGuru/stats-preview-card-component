## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Throughout this challenge, I learned how to use flex and grid and I did have difficulties with getting the card to be responsive for a mobile design.

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning css and using css as much as possible, in addition to reading web development documentation in order to learn more concepts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
